      Dinosaurs, mighty giants, inhabited
      the Earth more than 60 million years ago. If the extinction of species had
      not occurred, they could surely have wiped out all creatures. You can check
      this out with the Jurassic mod for Bedrock Minecraft. Introduce the most dangerous
      reptiles into the block world and test how long you can resist these monsters.


      Fossil
      ore is a new type of blocks created everywhere. Creating a dinosaur will start
      with mining ore.


      Different types of fossils and remains are available.


      Permafrost
      allows you to collect ore from recently deceased animals, such as the bones
      of Dodo or Smilodon, which is also known as a saber-toothed tiger.


      DNA:
      a number of items are needed to obtain DNA.


      A workbench, a light gray
      carpet, and unknown remains are the components used to separate the remains
      from dirt or gravel using a sieve.


      Extractions: To extract the DNA
      from the remains, you will need a Kraft extractor consisting of seven smooth
      stones, a redstone, and a syringe. The DNA needs to be extracted into a storage
      disk, and then enhance that disk before extracting it into the syringe.


      A
      cultivator is used to obtain spun eggs. It consists of six smooth stones and
      a glass block. You must take the DNA and combine it with the dinosaur egg.
      For mammals, you have to put the DNA in the cultivator, get a new kind of syringe,
      interact with the pig and wait.


      Frozen Dodo meat comes from permafrost
      and is used as a weapon because it is very tough, you can thaw it and get meat.


      The
      Dilophosaurus does nine damage, the wolf''s speed is six blocks long and two
      blocks high. Cooked or raw meat is used for taming. It is possible to tether
      it with a leash, but this is difficult to do.


      Velociraptors are similar
      to wolves, can tame and control a bone, sleep during the day and reproduce
      with meat.


      Pteranodon can fly, are controlled by a nautilus shell and
      are food for fish.


      The new version has added dinosaurs, armor, improved
      health and mob fights, removed some items, fixed bugs and many other minor
      changes and improvements.'

    m_Localized: 'Mod: Ark Mobs



      With the Arkcraft mod, there will be a lot
      of new things in MCPE, including blocks and mobs. The addition will add variety
      as well as improve gameplay. Meet your upcoming neighbors and learn about new
      blocks and items taken from the Ark game.


      Everything is done on the
      kitchen table.


      Animal feed is used to raise certain types of animals
      such as aquatic, carnivores, herbivores, and arthropods.


      Tools: Cat
      hook and hook: used to lift and move quickly; Crossbow and soporific arrows:
      used to stun dinosaurs.


      Kompi turns into a Velonosaurus egg thanks
      to the R vaccine.


      Thermal wool can be obtained by feeding dimetrodon
      wool. This wool is used to hatch Velonosaurus or Magmasaurus eggs.


      Poisonous
      ammonites, also known as green ammonites, can be extracted from a bowl of sleeping
      pills. It is made from soporific berries and rotting meat.


      Scargotha
      mucus eliminates nausea and helps regenerate


      Ankylosaurus is an aggressive
      predator that deals more damage to sauropods and replaces algae with moss when
      attacking. Taming: it needs to be stunned with a crossbow and soporific arrows,
      then fed. It can ride (medium predator saddle) and use its whip abilities.


      Gualicho
      is very strong, dangerous in a pack, and can walk on loose snow. To feed him,
      he must be stunned with a crossbow and soporific arrows. He can also ride a
      large raptor saddle and use a whip.


      Argentavis aggressive flies and
      does not stop until it catches up to the player. Taming: can be made to make
      the mob stuck, making it easy to tame. Effect: desiccation: allows you to ride
      the argentavis saddle and use its whip abilities.


      Carnotaurus increases
      his speed and strength in a moment of rage, and imposes desiccation. When he
      rides (on a large raptor saddle), he becomes slower but gains resistance effect
      2.

      Active


      Llukalkan is a very fast mob. It works as a radar.
      A brigand''s sound points to an outpost within 500 blocks, a villager''s sound
      points to an igloo or village within 500 blocks, and a champion''s sound points
      to a mansion or outpost within 500 blocks. The aggressive can ride (medium
      predator saddle) and use a whip.
